[Supabase](https://supabase.io) is an open source Firebase alternative. We're building the features of Firebase using enterprise-grade open source tools.

This repository contains all the functionality for Supabase CLI.

- [x] Running Supabase locally
- [x] Managing database migrations
- [x] Creating and deploying Supabase Functions
- [x] Generating types directly from your database schema
- [x] Making authenticated HTTP requests to [Management API](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/api/introduction)

## Getting started

### Install the CLI

Available via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) as dev dependency. To install:

```bash
npm i supabase --save-dev
```

To install the beta release channel:

```bash
npm i supabase@beta --save-dev
```

When installing with yarn 4, you need to disable experimental fetch with the following nodejs config.

```
NODE_OPTIONS=--no-experimental-fetch yarn add supabase
```

> **Note**
For Bun versions below v1.0.17, you must add `supabase` as a [trusted dependency](https://bun.sh/guides/install/trusted) before running `bun add -D supabase`.

  brew upgrade supabase
  ```

  #### via Linux packages

  Linux packages are provided in [Releases](https://github.com/supabase/cli/releases). To install, download the `.apk`/`.deb`/`.rpm`/`.pkg.tar.zst` file depending on your package manager and run the respective commands.

  ```sh
  sudo apk add --allow-untrusted <...>.apk
  ```

  ```sh
  sudo dpkg -i <...>.deb

  <summary><b>Other Platforms</b></summary>

  You can also install the CLI via [go modules](https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-install) without the help of package managers.

  ```sh
  go install github.com/supabase/cli@latest
  ```

  Add a symlink to the binary in `$PATH` for easier access:

  ```sh
  ln -s "$(go env GOPATH)/bin/cli" /usr/bin/supabase
  ```

  This works on other non-standard Linux distros.

<details>
  <summary><b>Community Maintained Packages</b></summary>

  Available via [pkgx](https://pkgx.sh/). Package script [here](https://github.com/pkgxdev/pantry/blob/main/projects/supabase.com/cli/package.yml).

### Run the CLI

```bash
supabase bootstrap
```

Or using npx:

```bash
npx supabase bootstrap
```

The bootstrap command will guide you through the process of setting up a Supabase project using one of the [starter](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-samples/blob/main/samples.json) templates.

## Docs

Command & config reference can be found [here](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/about).

## Breaking changes

We follow semantic versioning for changes that directly impact CLI commands, flags, and configurations.

However, due to dependencies on other service images, we cannot guarantee that schema migrations, seed.sql, and generated types will always work for the same CLI major version. If you need such guarantees, we encourage you to pin a specific version of CLI in package.json.

## Developing

To run from source:

```sh
# Go >= 1.22
go run . help
```

# Yoga Flow Planner React

A React-based yoga flow planning application with drag-and-drop functionality for organizing canvases and folders.

## Features

### Drag and Drop Sidebar
- **Canvas Management**: Drag canvases between folders or to the top-level flows list
- **Folder Organization**: Reorder folders by dragging them
- **Canvas Reordering**: Reorder canvases within the same folder or flows list
- **Visual Feedback**: Smooth animations and visual indicators during drag operations
- **Auto-scroll**: Automatic scrolling when dragging near container edges

### How to Use Drag and Drop

1. **Move Canvas to Folder**: Drag any canvas and drop it onto a folder to move it inside.
2. **Reorder Canvases**: Drag a canvas and drop it above or below another canvas to reorder.
3. **Move Canvas to Flows**: Drag a canvas out of a folder and drop it in the Flows section to make it top-level.
4. **Reorder Folders**: Drag a folder and drop it above or below another folder to reorder.
5. **Visual Feedback**: The sidebar provides visual cues (highlight, opacity, and placeholder) during drag and drop.

### Technical Notes
- The drag-and-drop system is powered by [snapdrag](https://github.com/tldraw/snapdrag).
- The sidebar uses custom draggable and droppable components (`DraggableCanvasRow`, `DraggableFolderRow`, `DroppableFlowsSection`) that wrap your sidebar rows and sections.
- The `Overlay` component from snapdrag is rendered at the root of the app for drag previews.
- All drag and drop logic is handled using the `useDraggable` and `useDroppable` hooks from snapdrag, following the recommended pattern from the [snapdrag-advanced-list](https://github.com/ljckn13/snapdrag-advanced-list) example.
